# %%
# Description
# Inserts number of spaces equal fullSpaces at the end of all but last words in a string and one additional space 
# for first leftSpaces words. Total numbers of spaces complement length of the string to maxW.
#
# Parameters
# string - string to be complemented with spaces
# maxW - number of chars in a final string
#
# Return
# Returns complemented string.

# %%
# Description
# This part creates desired output. It takes parts of the input and stores it in temp.
# Then it iterates through temp starting from the end until only whole words are chosen. Then it takes the lenght
# of the temp variable before the spaces are added and adds it to the cond variable.
# This ensures correct breaking of the last line. After this spaces are added with addSpaces function. After the 
# spaces are placed, the whole line is added to the output table. When the loop is terminated, the 
# remaining text is added to the end of out. In the end output is printed as string.
#
# Variables
# maxW - as in addSpaces function
# inp - input text. Too long text causes errors.
# out - output text
# i - points to a place in inp from which new line is taken
# cond - terminates the loop when length of the input is shorter then text taken so far + maxW
# temp - line of text which will go to output after cutting to full words and inserting spaces
# j - position at which last full word of temp ends
# char - takes a letter from temp in purpose of checking if it is a space
#
